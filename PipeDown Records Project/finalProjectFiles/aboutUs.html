		<h1>A History of Spirited Independence</h1>
		<h3>As ongoing corporate consolidation transforms the music industry, the biggest beneficiary of the restructuring has been the independent sector. Over the last several years the independents have consistently surpassed many of the multinationals in market share. A leader among this group of independent labels is Pipe Down Records.</h3>
        <h3>Treble Clef, President and founder Pipe Down Records, launched the label out of his Omaha apartment in 1999 with the release of Television's Greatest Hits, an eight volume series chronicling the history of the TV theme song. The label currently maintains an ever-growing staff of 10 people in Omaha, Nebraska. Pipe Down Records prides itself on grass roots artist development. </h3>
