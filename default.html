		<h3> I am a Web Developer and Designer. I love the internet and I am passionate about doing what I can to 
		make the internet an exciting and enjoyable place to spend our valuable time on.</h3>

		through the construction of advertisement flyers, video presentations and countless photo edits along with  
		web page designs. I encourage you to take a few moments to view some <a href="#projectExamples">examples</a>
		of my work.</h3>

		<h3>I attack every challenge with enthusiasm and seek to solve the puzzle that is laid out before me.  I 
		relish the opportunities to create something out of nothing.  I can help you by crafting your vision 
		into a valuable asset.
	
		<h3>In addition to my web development abilities, I also bring you over 25 years of experience through
		military discipline and experience as well as customer service positions where I learned the 
		importance of excellent customer service. Years of military service taught me discipline, multi-tasking,
		time management and how to work under pressure while ensuring that my deadlines are met. I am a team
		player and I am always looking to learn new ideas and techniques and am not afraid to ask if I can't
		quite "figure it out". </h3>
		
		<h3> I 
		have always looked at coding as building a puzzle that I get to create and then construct.</h3>
