		<h3> Here is the list of techniques and how I used them:</h3>
		
			<ul>
				<li> I created the banner image from scratch where I drew the palm trees using my tablet from scratch and then used 
					the initials T & D with an outer glow on their respective layers </li>
				<li> I created the spring garden show advertisement by creating a gradient filled background layer, then used several 
					text layers to insert the text about the ad.  I then opened several of the floral images and used the lasso tool
					to select the flowers and copy then paste into new layers in the image.  Then I could remove the unwanted portions 
					of the image with the magic wand and delete keys.  Each flower was added on a separate layer to make it easier to manipulate </li>
				<li> I created the inline image by using a beach scene that had a child in it.  I removed the child using the spot healing brush
					with duplicate layer then I created another layer to cut and paste in some palm trees.  I then used the magic wand and delete keys
					to remove unwanted portions of that image </li>
				<li> I used all images that were provided in the link that was on the midterm minus the image I created from scratch </li>
				
			</ul>
